# This is the milestone one

In this task, I'm asked to create a front-end only React application that uses Canvas to draw a given image when the start button is clicked. In addition to that, when the button is not yet clicked, there should be a dot-dashed border that outlines the area of that Canvas with width 360px and height 640px.

## To launch this app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

and then:

### `npm start`
